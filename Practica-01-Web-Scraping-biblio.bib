abstract="The media and entertainment industries are evolving at an unprecedented rate, driven by the twin needs to reduce operating costs and simultaneously generate more revenue from increasingly competitive and uncertain markets. Media companies are in many respects an early adopter of big data technologies because it enables them to drive digital transformation, exploiting more fully not only data which was already available, but also new sources of data from both inside and outside the organization. This chapter presents a wide-ranging overview of the state of the art of big data in the media sector. It introduces the industrial needs, application scenarios, and other aspects of the sector and describes how they influence, and are influenced by, products, customers, and processes. Finally, the research is distilled into a comprehensive set of requirements across the entire big data value chain, alongside the consolidated roadmap tracking the development of key technologies to support semantic data enrichment, data quality, data-driven innovation, and data analysis.",
